          not the nested region holding the field,
        - scroll-bar jump (End/Home) as a last resort.

        Bounded and never fatal: if it cannot be brought into view the action
        is left as-is so sandbox validation still blocks it safely.

        The visibility check itself is UNCONDITIONAL - it runs even while the
        round-level reveal pass holds the scroll lock (`_lock_scrolling`).
        Only the lock's job (deciding whether the executor may run its own
        full, multi-strategy exploratory scroll) is gated; whether a field is
        actually on-screen right now must always be checked, and if it is
        not, at least one corrective nudge is always allowed. A batch of
        "visible" actions is planned once from a single scene snapshot, but
        that snapshot can go stale mid-batch (an earlier action in the same
        batch reflows the page, a dropdown opens and shifts layout, a
        server-driven update lands) - refusing to correct for that here means
        the click for that field silently lands nowhere, focus stays on the
        PREVIOUS field, and clear_field()'s Ctrl+A then wipes that field's
        content instead of the intended one. That silent failure mode - never
        an exception, just a field quietly clicked and cleared on the wrong
        target - is what made it look like the loop "gets stuck" without ever
        scrolling. Always confirming visibility here, exactly as done before
        every single field fill in the reference implementation this was
        ported from, closes that gap without touching how the round-level
        pass owns and paces its own bulk scrolling.

        ``attempt`` closes a second, subtler gap: the "is the bbox still
        inside the client rect" check above only catches a field that left
        the viewport entirely. It does NOT catch a field that merely SHIFTED
        by a modest amount - e.g. a cascading dropdown (a Sub Caste list
        driven by a Caste choice) reflowing the layout below it - because the
        stale bbox can still land inside the client rect while pointing at
        the wrong spot entirely (blank space, a neighbouring control, or
        nothing). That produces a very specific, previously mysterious
        failure signature: the click "succeeds" (no exception), but the
        OCR/clipboard verification reads back nothing for that field AND for
        every field after it in the same batch, since they all came from the
        one stale pre-batch snapshot and are now offset by the same reflow.
        On the FIRST attempt this cost is not worth paying (the common case
        is a batch whose snapshot is still accurate); once an attempt has
        already failed verification, though, the field's true current bbox
        is looked up fresh, unconditionally, before retrying - cheap relative
        to the four-attempt retry ladder it replaces, and it self-heals the
        rest of the batch too since each field re-checks itself the same way.
