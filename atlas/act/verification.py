"""Structured verification results and a status-aware verification engine.

The executor no longer treats verification as binary. Every read produces a
``VerificationResult`` carrying an explicit status:

- ``MATCH``          - evidence confirms the field holds the expected value.
- ``MISMATCH``       - evidence shows a *different* readable value.
- ``UNKNOWN``        - no usable read could be obtained (empty reads, read
                       failures, whole-window clipboard grabs, no verifier).
                       This is NOT a mismatch: retrying the action would just
                       repeat the write on a field whose value may be correct.
- ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` - the field/value does not require verification.
- ``PENDING``        - verification not yet attempted.

UNKNOWN is the core fix for the MPF regression: an empty UIA read or a
whole-window clipboard grab used to collapse into plain ``False`` and trigger
a full action-retry ladder (70-80s per field). Now the executor classifies it
as ``ACTION_SUCCESS_VERIFICATION_UNKNOWN`` and moves on.
