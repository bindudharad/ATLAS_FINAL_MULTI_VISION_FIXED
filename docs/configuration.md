# Configuration

All settings load from environment variables, optionally from a `.env` file in
the working directory (see `.env.example`). Values are read when
`load_config()` is called, so overrides take effect at startup, not import
time. Paths for screenshots and logs are created eagerly.

## Vision (`VisionConfig`) - the primary perception channel

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VISION_PROVIDER` | `auto` | `auto`, `openai`, `gemini`, `local`, `mock` |
| `VISION_MODEL` | *(empty)* | model name (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`) |
| `VISION_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | API key for the VLM endpoint |
| `VISION_API_BASE` | *(empty)* | OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `VISION_TIMEOUT` | `60` | request timeout in seconds (1-600) |
| `VISION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.4` | minimum element confidence (0-1) |

`auto` uses a configured VLM endpoint if present, otherwise falls back to the
rule-based heuristic provider.

## Reasoning (`ReasoningConfig`)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REASONING_PROVIDER` | `auto` | `auto`, `openai`, `gemini` |
| `REASONING_MODEL` | *(empty)* | model name |
| `REASONING_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | API key |
| `REASONING_API_BASE` | *(empty)* | OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `REASONING_TIMEOUT` | `60` | request timeout in seconds (1-600) |
| `REASONING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.5` | plan confidence floor (0-1) |

## OCR (`OcrConfig`) - explicit fallback only

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OCR_ENGINE` | `paddle` | `paddle` or `tesseract` |
| `OCR_LANG` | `en` | language |
| `OCR_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.4` | minimum line confidence (0-1) |

## Mouse (`MouseConfig`) - human-like behaviour

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MOUSE_BEZIER_STEPS` | `35` | points in the bezier path |
| `MOUSE_SPEED` | `0.35` | movement speed factor |
| `MOUSE_MIN_DELAY` / `MOUSE_MAX_DELAY` | `0.05` / `0.25` | random move delay range (s) |
| `MOUSE_PAUSE_BEFORE_CLICK` / `MOUSE_PAUSE_AFTER_CLICK` | `0.08` / `0.10` | click pauses (s) |
| `MOUSE_JITTER_PX` | `3` | click position jitter (px) |
| `MOUSE_DOUBLE_CLICK_INTERVAL` | `0.30` | max gap for double-click (s) |

## Typing (`TypingConfig`)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TYPING_MIN_DELAY` / `TYPING_MAX_DELAY` | `0.05` / `0.25` | per-keystroke delay range (s) |
| `TYPING_PAUSE_AFTER` | `0.15` | pause after typing (s) |
| `TYPING_USE_CLIPBOARD_FOR_LONG` | `true` | paste long values instead of typing |
| `TYPING_CLIPBOARD_MIN_LENGTH` | `25` | minimum length to use clipboard |
| `TYPING_SIMULATE_TYPOS` | `true` | introduce and fix rare typos |
| `TYPING_TYPO_RATE` | `0.02` | typo probability (0-1) |

## Observe (`ObserveConfig`)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OBSERVE_POLL_INTERVAL` | `0.8` | capture interval in seconds (0.05-60) |
| `OBSERVE_CAPTURE_FORMAT` | `png` | screenshot format |
| `OBSERVE_SCREENSHOT_DIR` | `screenshots` | debug screenshot folder |

## Workflow (`WorkflowConfig`)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WORKFLOW_VERIFY_AFTER_ACTION` | `true` | verify every value action |
| `WORKFLOW_MAX_RETRIES_PER_ACTION` | `3` | retries before recovery |
| `WORKFLOW_RETRY_DELAY` | `0.8` | delay between retries (s) |
| `WORKFLOW_NEXT_RECORD_TIMEOUT` | `120` | wait for next record (s) |
| `WORKFLOW_NEXT_RECORD_POLL` | `1.5` | poll interval for next record (s) |
| `WORKFLOW_MAX_RECORDS` | `0` | stop after N records (0 = unlimited) |
| `WORKFLOW_SINGLE_FORM_MODE` | `false` | SINGLE-FORM TEST MODE: process exactly ONE complete form, then terminate ATLAS cleanly (never advances to record 2, never restarts, leaves the target application open). Forces MAX_RECORDS=1. |
| `WORKFLOW_SINGLE_FORM_UPLOAD` | `false` | whether single-form mode may click "Upload Details". Default `false` = the fill+verify test mode: NEVER uploads, the completed form stays on screen. Set `true` only for the run that must also submit the record. |
| `WORKFLOW_LOG_SCREENSHOTS` | `true` | save annotated screenshots |
| `WORKFLOW_SCAN_REVEAL_FIELDS` | `true` | after filling the visible viewport, scroll down to reveal and fill below-the-fold fields, then click submit once |

When `WORKFLOW_SCAN_REVEAL_FIELDS` is enabled the agent behaves like a human
operator: it reads the whole visible viewport first, fills every visible field
one-by-one in strict visual order (never grouped by control type), verifies
each value, and only then scrolls (both the left source panel and the right
entry panel together) to reveal the next band of fields. It stops scrolling
when a scroll no longer changes the layout (form bottom / Upload Details
reached) and clicks submit/upload exactly once at the end.

## Overlay (`OverlayConfig`)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OVERLAY_ENABLED` | `true` | show the floating status overlay |
| `OVERLAY_ANIMATION_FPS` | `30` | overlay refresh rate |
| `OVERLAY_COMMAND_PORT` | `19765` | overlay control port |

## Controller (`ControllerConfig`)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONTROLLER_COMMAND_PORT` | `19768` | JSON command server port |

## Memory (`MemoryConfig`)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MEMORY_DB_PATH` | `memory.db` | SQLite database file |
| `MEMORY_ALIAS_LEARNING` | `true` | persist verified fuzzy mappings |

## Logging & debug (`LogConfig`, `AppConfig`)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `DEBUG` | logging level |
| `LOG_FOLDER` | `logs` | log output folder |
| `DEBUG_MODE` | `false` | global debug flag |
